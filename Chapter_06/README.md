# Weekly Graded Assignment Instructions

A year is a **leap year** if it is divisible by 4, unless it is a century that is not divisible by 400.

For example:

* 1956 is a leap year because 1956 is divisible by 4.
* 1957 is not a leap year, because it is not divisible by 4.
* 1900 is not a leap year, despite the fact that it is divisible by 4, because 1900 is a century and 1900 is not divisible by 400.
* 1600 is a leap year, because 1600 is divisible by 4 and 1600 is divisible by 400

Write a function ``is_Leap`` that takes a year as a parameter and returns ``True`` if the year is a leap year, ``False`` otherwise.
